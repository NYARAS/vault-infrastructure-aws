# vault-infrastructure-aws
Deploy Hashicorp Vault+Consul to dynamically generate short-lived credentials per pod.

### Vault Auth Methods

Different auth methods have different intentions and purposes. The following defines what different auth methods are intended for within Vault:
-  Machine-oriented: AppRole, TLS, tokens, platform-specific methods (cloud, k8s)
-  Operator-oriented: Github, LDAP, username & password

### Vault Agent is a client daemon that provides the following features:

- Auto-Auth - Automatically authenticate to Vault and manage the token renewal process for locally-retrieved dynamic secrets.
- Caching - Allows client-side caching of responses containing newly created tokens and responses containing leased secrets generated off of these newly created tokens.
- Templating - Allows rendering of user-supplied templates by Vault Agent, using the token generated by the Auto-Auth step.

### Token Accessors

When tokens are created, a token accessor is also created and returned. This accessor is a value that acts as a reference to a token and can only be used to perform limited actions:

  - Look up a token's properties (not including the actual token ID)
  - Look up a token's capabilities on a path
  - Renew the token
  - Revoke the token
