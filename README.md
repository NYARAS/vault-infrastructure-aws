# vault-infrastructure-aws
Deploy Hashicorp Vault+Consul to dynamically generate short-lived credentials per pod.

### Vault Tokens
- `Service token` is the general token that most people talk about when referring to a token in Vault.
- `Batch token` is an encrypted binary large object (blobs) that carries just enough information for authentication.
- `Periodic service tokens` have a TTL, but no max TTL.
- `Orphan tokens` are not children of their parent; therefore, do not expire when their parent does.

#### TTL and Max TTL
The `TTL` defines when the token will expire. If the token reaches its TTL, it will be immediately revoked by Vault. The `Max TTL` defines the maximum timeframe for which the token can be renewed. Once the max TTL is reached, the token cannot be renewed any longer and will be revoked.

### Vault Auth Methods

Different auth methods have different intentions and purposes. The following defines what different auth methods are intended for within Vault:
-  Machine-oriented: AppRole, TLS, tokens, platform-specific methods (cloud, k8s)
-  Operator-oriented: Github, LDAP, username & password

### Vault Agent is a client daemon that provides the following features:

- Auto-Auth - Automatically authenticate to Vault and manage the token renewal process for locally-retrieved dynamic secrets.
- Caching - Allows client-side caching of responses containing newly created tokens and responses containing leased secrets generated off of these newly created tokens.
- Templating - Allows rendering of user-supplied templates by Vault Agent, using the token generated by the Auto-Auth step.

### Token Accessors

When tokens are created, a token accessor is also created and returned. This accessor is a value that acts as a reference to a token and can only be used to perform limited actions:

  - Look up a token's properties (not including the actual token ID)
  - Look up a token's capabilities on a path
  - Renew the token
  - Revoke the token
